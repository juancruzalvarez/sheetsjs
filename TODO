-fix past bug not updating dependant cells correctly
-should change cell to subscribe to part of state only, not whole cells array.
maybe it does not affect performance because memo, but should check.
-add behaviour for selecting while editing a formula to automatically add cell references.
-add macro editor
-add serialization
-considerate adding exporting to other formats. probly not very feasible at least with formulas. but inspect posibility-.
